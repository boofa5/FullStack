## 23.1 Lesson Plan - Portfolio & Career HW Work <!--links--> &nbsp; [⬅️](../../22-Week/03-Day/03-Day-LessonPlan.md) &nbsp; [➡️](../02-Day/02-Day-LessonPlan.md)

### Overview

In this class, students who have opted-in to career services will work on their portfolios and any unfinished career homework assignments.

##### Instructor Priorities

* Students are supported in creation of their portfolios like any other HW assignment or project.

* Students opted out of Career Services are encouraged to participate - it's the developer's resume! However, they are welcome to work on final projects.

##### Instructor Notes

* Students' portfolio assignment in Bootcampspot will contain requirements & guidance to get students started.

* Defer to CDs when it comes to advice on items like Resumes or Linkedin presence. We want to ensure that we are presenting students with a consistent message.

* As Instructors / TAs, keep in mind that the success of your students post-bootcamp is largely dictated by the quality of their final projects and portfolios. Encourage and help steer them in every way you can towards high-quality production!
