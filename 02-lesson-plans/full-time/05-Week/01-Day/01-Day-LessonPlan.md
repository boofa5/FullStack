### Overview

In this class, class will center on project work. You and the TAs should check up on each group and make sure they're moving smoothly toward completion.

##### Instructor Priorities

* Students should have the entirety of class to work on their projects.

* Make sure your students make measurable progress with their project work.

##### Instructor Notes

* Your students will be nearing the end of their projects. Even though it's the beginning of the week, you should push students to finish their apps early so they have optimal time to practice their presentations.

* It's **crucial** that you steer any off-course projects back on track.
