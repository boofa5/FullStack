## 01-Day Lesson Plan - Review Day & Intro to Timing Events <!--links--> &nbsp; [⬅️](../../02-Week/05-Day/05-Day-LessonPlan.md) &nbsp; [➡️](../02-Day/02-Day-LessonPlan.md)

### Overview

In this class, we will be providing students an opportunity to review old JavaScript activities to gain a stronger foothold in the fundamentals. We will briefly review JavaScript and jQuery concepts before learning about Timing Events.


`Summary: Review JavaScript and jQuery & Complete activities 04-08 in Unit 05`

##### Instructor Priorities

* Build student confidence and mastery of concepts covered so far.
* Provide students with an extended opportunity for supported coding.
* Allow students to revisit critical assignments, exercises, and homework covered in class so far.


##### Instructor Notes

* Today's first half of the class is dedicated exclusively to review in our program. At this point in the program, your students are likely to feel weathered by the JavaScript immersion. Let them know this is their chance to get caught up!

* During today's activity, the focus is on pairing like-level students so they can review old material with one another. Pairing equal-levels also helps as it allows you and the TAs concentrate on students who need the most significant help. Consider pulling these students out of class and working with them in another space if one is available.

* Make sure to congratulate students today. They are only two weeks in and they have learned a ton. Now is a good opportunity to remind them that not long ago they came through the door knowing very little to nothing about web development and today they can already build an entire working website! Pretty impressive.

### 1. Instructor Do: Cover Day's Agenda (5 minutes)

* Explain to the class that today will be focused on providing an opportunity for review and recalibration. The class will be divided into three sections.
  1. A few moments to answer lingering questions;
  2. A high-level overview of all the major topics covered; and
  3. Two hours of coding in small groups, either redoing select assignments or working on a new project.

### 2. Instructor Do: Collect Student Feedback (10-15 minutes)

* Using Poll Everywhere or a similar anonymous method have students provide open feedback regarding the general subjects or concepts they feel least comfortable with. Be sure to provide adequate time for all students to provide feedback

* Then, offer brief (VERY BRIEF) commentary on the subjects.

* Open the floor to specific questions tied to these subjects

### 3. Instructor Do: Organize Groups (5 minutes)

* Divide the class into pre-defined groups based on personalities and general mastery of the subject so far. Be sure to pair strong students with strong students and weaker students with weaker ones. If possible, this should be done PRIOR to class.

* Have students switch seats and join their defined groups

### 4. Instructor Do: Review (20 minutes)

* Using the [slides](SlideShow) provided as a guide, quickly list and explain (at a high-level) the key takeaways students should feel comfortable with at this point in the class. Encourage the class to take note of any topics that remain difficult and to write them down as you speak.

* Be sure to ask individual students questions from time to time to maintain engagement!

* After discussing each section, give the groups a moment to talk to one another and confirm that they understand the topics presented. If there are any issues, encourage them to raise the questions to one another—and if no member of the team can can answer, to then raise it to the class.

* Continue this way until all topics have been covered. Just aim to have at least 2 hours of class time left by the time this recap is complete.

### 5. Instructor Do: Provide Activity Guidelines (5 minutes)

* Task the student groups with choosing one of four different group assignments to work on for the remainder of class. Each group should decide which activity/ies to choose based on the following paradigm.

* Slack out the following instructions:

* **Instructions:**

  * As a group, choose to complete one of the following tasks. Use the information provided below as a guide.

    * Can you and your team comfortably build the Hangman Game (HW 3) from scratch?

      * No? Then start with Hangman.

    * Can you and your team conceptually explain how "Captain Planet The Game” works?

      * No? Then start by dissecting "Captain Planet the Game".

    * Can you and your team comfortably use jQuery to modify HTML based on clicks?

      * No? Then start with Lottery Generator.

    * Can you and your team comfortably create a grid-based design with Twitter Bootstrap?

      * No? Then start with the Bootstrap Portfolio assignment.

### 6. Students Do: Activities (2 hours)

* Students begin coding. Be sure to encourage them to try coding from scratch if possible. TAs and Instructors should use this time to assist students where needed.

### 7. LUNCH BREAK (30 minutes)

### 8. Students Do: Coin Flipper (15 mins)

* Students will be building an app that allows them to guess the outcome of a coin flip, and track their wins/losses.

* Open `coin-flip-solution.html` in `04-CoinFlip/solution` in Chrome and demo it for the class.

* Slack out the following instructions and files to the class:

* **Instructions:**

  * Make a Coin Flipper game.

  * Follow the directions in the html file.

  * How the app works:

    * The user chooses Heads or Tails, and the computer randomly selects heads or tails and displays the outcome on the screen. The app then displays whether or not the user won or lost.
    * If heads, use: <http://random-ize.com/coin-flip/us-quarter/us-quarter-front.jpg>
    * If tails, display: <http://random-ize.com/coin-flip/us-quarter/us-quarter-back.jpg>

  * **BONUS**:
    * Put your JavaScript in its own file and link to it in the HTML.
    * Keep track of the number of Heads or Tails and display the results on the screen.
    * Add CSS styling.

* **File**: [coin-flip.html](../../../../01-Class-Content/05-timers/01-Activities/04-CoinFlip/Unsolved/coin-flip.html)

### 9. Everyone Do: Coin Flipper Review (10 mins)

* Open the code for the coin flipper solution `coin-flip-solution.hmtl` & `coinFlipSolution.js`

* Call on students and work through the solution to the exercise.

### 10. Instructor Do: Recap (5 mins)

* Recap key concepts from the Coin Flipper exercise and answer any final questions.

### 11. Partners Do: This Activity (10 mins)

* For this next exercise, make sure students are working with a partner!

* Slack out the following instructions and files:

* **Instructions**:

  * Find a partner.
  * Together, open the supplied HTML file and answer all questions.

* **File**: `this.html` in `05-This`

### 12. Everyone Do: This Review (5 mins)

* Open the code to the 'This' exercise: `this-solution.html` in `05-This`.

* Choose a team/pair of students to go over their solution to the exercise.

* Run each function to see if they are correct or not.

### 13. Instructor Do: Timeout (10 mins)

* Open `timeout.html` in `06-Timeout`.

* Introduce `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` (we will get to `setInterval` after the break).

* Go through the code and explain what it's doing.

* Be sure to mention these are vanilla JavaScript methods, not jQuery!

### 14. Instructor Do: Context (5 mins)

* Open `context.html` in `07-Context`.

* Explain how `this` inside of functions executed by a `setTimeout` are scoped to the window!

* Don't dwell on this but mention it: the functions are run in a different `execution context`.

  * So for `setTimeout(person.sayHi, 50);`, inside the `sayHi` function, `this` is the window, it isn't the person object anymore.

  * To be able to access the person object in the `sayHi` function when passing it to `setTimeout`, you have to use the person object in `sayHi`.

* Don't talk about call or bind here - WE DO NOT WANT TO FREAK THE STUDENTS OUT!

### 15. Students Do: Simple Timer (10 mins)

* Slack out the following instructions and files:

* **Instructions**:

  * Make a page with a a simple timer that sends an alert and plays a sound after 15 seconds.
  * Have it send an alert when 5 seconds has passed, 10 seconds has passed and when the time is up.
  * You will use this to time the break!

* **File**: `simple-timer.html` in `08-SimpleTimer/skeleton`

### 16. Instructor Do: Simple Timer Recap (5 mins)

* Open the solution to the Simple Timer activity in `08-SimpleTimer/solution`

* Recap the key concepts of the exercise and answer any remaining questions.

### 17. TA's Do: Introduce Homework (2 mins)

* Present the homework - there are two options, a basic trivia game and a slightly more advanced one.

* The students have learned everything they need to complete the homework, and can complete it tonight.

* Play the two videos (`advanced-trivia-demo.mov` and `basic-trivia-demo.mov`)
