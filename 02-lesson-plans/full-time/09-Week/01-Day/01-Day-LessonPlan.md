* Make sure your students make measurable progress with their project work.

##### Instructor Notes

* Your students will be nearing the end of their projects. Even though it's the beginning of the week, you should push students to finish their apps so they have optimal time to practice their presentations.

* It's **crucial** that you steer any off-course projects back on track.
