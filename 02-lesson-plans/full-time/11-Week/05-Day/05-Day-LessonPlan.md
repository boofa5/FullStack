## 05-Day Lesson Plan - Big O & Data Structures <!--links--> &nbsp; [⬅️](../04-Day/04-Day-LessonPlan.md) &nbsp; [➡️](../../12-Week/01-Day/01-Day-LessonPlan.md)

### Overview

Today's lesson will introduce students to the notions of time complexity; Big O analysis; and basic data structures.

`Summary: Complete activities 6-8 in Unit 22`


#### Instructor Priorities

* Students should be able to define the term _time complexity_.

* Students should be able to articulate why knowledge of time complexity is practical.

* Students should be able to explain how an algorithm's running time grows as a function of the size of its input, given its time complexity as expressed in Big O notation.

* Students should be able to map today's data structure to a given use case.

#### Instructor Notes

* Most students are unlikely to have strong mathematics backgrounds. For them, today's coverage of Big O may be more intimidating than necessary. Focus on building facility with heuristics for determining time complexity, rather than couching it in the formal language of asymptotic analysis.

* Students are allotted generous amounts of time for activities, to account for varying levels of background. Feel free to shorten these time allowances, or skip activities entirely, so students can spend more time working on projects.

* Have your instructors refer to the [Time Tracker](05-Day-TimeTracker.xlsx) to stay on track.

### Class Objectives

* Students should be able to calculate Big O bounds on the running time of simple algorithms.

* Students should be able to identify which data structures are best suited to certain tasks.

### 1. Instructor Do: Time Complexity & Big O (20 mins)

* Today's lesson will be more lecture- than exercise-driven.

  * This is because exercises for CS material require more time than we can take from student projects.

  * Be sure to direct students to [Interview Bit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) for practice.

* Open the [slide deck](SlideShow), and discuss the slides through the Big O section.

  * These are slides 0 - 81.

  * Most of these are single-line slides, so it moves faster than the numbers would suggest.

### 2. Students Do: Big O Activity (20 mins)

* Slack out the `07-Big-O/Examples/big_o.md`, and let students work on them.

* Feel free to execute this as a **Partners Do** exercise if you would prefer.

* This exercise is optional. Cut it short or skip it in favor of projects as you see fit.

### 3. Instructor Do: Review Activity (10 mins)

* Review the `07-Big-O/Solutions/solutions.md`, and address any questions that arise.

### 4. Instructor Do: Data Structures (20 mins)

* Return to the [slide deck](SlideShow), and discuss the Data Structures slides.

  * These are slides 81 onwards.

### 5. Students Do: Data Structures Activity (20 mins)

* Slack out the `08-Data-Structures/Examples/questions.md`, and let students work on them for up to 20 minutes.

* As with the previous exercise, feel free to skip or abbreviate this activity, as necessary.

### 6. Instructor Do: Review Activity (10 mins)

* Review the `08-Data-Structures/Solutions/solutions.md`.

* Ask different students to share and justify their answers to each question.

### 7. LUNCH BREAK (30 mins)

- - -

### 8. Projects (Remainder)

* Address any outstanding questions.

* If none remain, slack out the link to [Interview Bit](http://www.interviewbit.com/).

  * Encourage them to spend at least ten minutes a day working on these questions, even after (maybe **especially** after!) finishing the Boot Camp.

  * Reassure them that this isn't _necessary_, but will drastically boost their confidence for technical interviews in the future.

* Dismiss students to work on projects for the remainder of class.
