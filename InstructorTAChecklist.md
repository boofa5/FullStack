# Instructor / TA Checklist

Ahoy! Here are some general tips and reminders for what to have done at each point of the week. 

If you have any outstanding questions, check with your SSM or review your [Training GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/read/book/the-coding-bootcamp/instructor-onboarding?key=TeachThatCode) which has all sorts of helpful information in it.

## Beginning of the Week

* Prepare!

* Review the next homework assignment.

## Before Class Starts

* Do a `git pull` of the [FullStack-Lesson-Plans](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/FullStack-Lesson-Plans) repo.

## Beginning of Class

* **Instructors** 

  * Start the Panopto recording. Copy/paste the link into the BCS session and slack out to students. Set "Primary Screen" to "Built-In Display" in order to record your active screen.
    
  * Open the day's `LessonPlan.md` file on a second display for yourself.

  * Open the entire day's `Activities` folder in your editor to easily move through the examples.

* **TAs**

  * Remind students to mark their attendance in BCS. Edit attendance as needed.

  * Open the day's `LessonPlan.md` file and follow along.

  * Open the `TimeTracker.xlsx` file to help the Instructor keep an eye on time.

  * Open the `VideoGuide.md` file and prepare to slack out video links during class.

## During Class

* **All** instructional team members should be circulating the room and helping out during activities!

* **TAs**
    
  * Slack out activities, solutions, and video links from `VideoGuide.md` as class goes on.

    * Drag the necessary zipped activity file into Slack's "Message" field. Enter instructions from Lesson Plan or accompanying `ReadMe.md` file into "Add Comment" field.

  * Monitor the `TimeTracker.xlsx` file and collaborate with the Instructor to make adjustments to the class schedule if needed.

## After Each Class
